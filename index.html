        <h1>St.Anselm Family</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>St. Anselm came from a noble Lombard family and was born in Aosta in the Italian Alps. His mother was a pious Burgundian, but after her death his father's violence and harshness finally caused Anselm to flee France. There, after several years of wandering, he took the Benedictine habit in 1060 at Bec (Normandy), where his countryman Bl. Lanfranc had started a school at the Abbey of Bec; soon he was well known for his learning. Within three years he was made Prior and after another 15 years Abbot.

As an abbot, St. Anselm had to travel to England from time to time in connection with his abbey's English properties. There he became known for his virtues and zeal: So much that in 1099 he was made Archbishop of Canterbury in the hope that he would be able to cope with the encroachments of King William the Red.

Many important writings of this general prelate, who was considered the greatest intellectual of his age, were composed during his two exiles. They earned him the title of Father of Scholasticism and Doctor of the Church (1720).</p>
